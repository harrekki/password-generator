# Password Generator

![Password Generator app](pw-generator.png)

Password Generator is a simple web app that creates secure passwords, allows the user to specify what characters to include in the passwords, and provides an easy copy-paste functionality. 

## Usage
Once deployed, the link will appear here!

If you want to run the app locally, download the files and point the browser to the `index.html` file on your local machine.  No installation is required.

## Project Purpose and Goals
This is a solo project from [Scrimba's](https://scrimba.com) Frontend Career Path program.  It was a great review of the basics, and I had fun with the stretch goals: basically all of the password options and the copy-paste functionality.  I didn't change the styles Scrimba provided very much, as I liked them (I did learn how annoying it is to customize input checkboxes tho ðŸ˜–), but I wanted to practice using Sass and refine UI elements.
